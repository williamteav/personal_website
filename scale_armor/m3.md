## The Tank

When the Germans launched Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, the primary operational Soviet heavy tanks were the KV-1 series. The KV-1s, while well-armored, retained the same armament as the T-34 medium tank and were substantially less mobile. As German tanks increased their armor and firepower, the need for a successor to the KV-1 became clear. Various upgrade measures were unsuccessful and Soviet designers set forth on creating a new vehicle.
 
These efforts eventually led to the IS-2, which entered service in the spring of 1944. The IS-2 served as a breakthrough tank against German defensive fortifications. However, its 122mm cannon and thick frontal armor also allowed the tank to successfully engage Panther and Tiger tanks. Compared to its Axis counterparts, the IS-2 was cramped, carried fewer rounds, and was slower to reload. Nevertheless, the IS-2 contributed to Soviet offenses across the Eastern Front and was notably present at the Battle of Berlin.

The IS-2 was developed into the ISU-152 tank destroyer and ISU-122 assault gun. Surviving IS-2s were later upgraded to the IS-2M standard in the late 1950s. A few were exported to Soviet customers in Asia and the Middle East. The IS-2 was eventually succeeded by the IS-3. 

## The Kit

The kit is in 1/72 scale and manufactured by Zvezda. This is both my first scale armor kit and my first kit from Zvezda. The tank represented by this kit is an IS-2 model 1944, which introduced a uniformly sloped front hull. Earlier IS-2s featured a section of frontal armor which steepened and created a vulnerability against incoming projectiles. An anti-aircraft machine gun was also added to the commanderâ€™s cupola. 

This model is intended to be a snap kit, meaning that no glue should be required. Indeed, many of the pieces could simply be press-fitted and a few even required significant exertion. Some of the smaller parts tended to wobble in place and required gluing. I would highly recommend a fine pair of tweezers and quality cutters. A hobby knife might work but would likely damage the tinier parts. 

## The Build

<p align="center"><img src="is2/9.JPG" alt="img" width="50%" height="50%" class="center"></p>

Turret and hull assembly were relatively straightforward.

The road wheels and sprockets did not fit in so easily. I had to enlargen the holes for most of the parts.

Each tread had two sets of pin connections which would allow the builder to wrap and press-fit. I was unable get the connections to meet, however, so I cut off the connections and wrapped the treads around.

It took a few tries to produce my ideal color of green but I eventually got there.

The decal sheet is for an IS-2 serving with the 7th Independent Guards Heavy Tank Brigade during the Battle of Berlin. The 7th Independent Guards can be identified by their insignia of a polar bear partially covering a red star. As the Soviets advanced westward across Germany, their armored vehicles applied white stripes to distinguish themselves to Allied aircraft. I found the stripe decals insufficient to cover the length of the turret so I opted to paint them myself.

## The Result

<p align="center"><img src="is2/19.JPG" alt="img" width="100%" height="100%" class="center"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="is2/20.JPG" alt="img" width="50%" height="50%" class="center"></p>

Overall, I enjoyed building the IS-2. There was nothing too complex and I think it would make a great kit for anyone looking to get started on modeling scale armor. I would definitely consider constructing another Zvezda tank kit.
