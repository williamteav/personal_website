Taking place at Naval Base Ventura County (NVBC) along the Southern California coast, the 2023 Point Mugu Air Show was open to the public on March 18 and 19. This was the first air show at NVBC since 2015 and it certainly attracted a massive crowd. I attended the air show on both Saturday and Sunday. With five hours of flying performances and plenty of unique aircraft on display, there was a lot to take in and I found myself not wanting to leave. 

The weather definitely was a factor in this year's airshow. Saturday was very pleasant and drew a much larger audience, resulting in lengthy hour-long waits to enter the premises. By contrast, spectators at the Sunday air show had to contend with the cold, wind, and rain. The security line was almost non-existent when I arrived in the morning but the crowd gradually increased in size as the day went on. 

Below are brief descriptions of just a few of the performers and displays at the air show:

The Super Hornet, nicknamed “Rhino”, is the frontline fighter of the US Navy. It succeeded the similar looking but smaller F/A-18 A-D models, now referred to as “legacy Hornets”.

Several of the Super Hornets present belonged to VX-31 “Dust Devils” and VX-9 “Vampires”. Both squadrons are based at aval Air Weapons Station China Lake. The Super Hornet which attracted the most attention was F/A-18F 166673, which was recently painted in the “Black Bunny” scheme.
