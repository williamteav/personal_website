# 2023 Southern California Air Show Static Displays 

The 2023 Southern California Air Show took place at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California from April 22-23. I attended the first day of the show and found it to be a mixed bag. Despite arriving prior to the gates opening, we waited in stop-and-go traffic for over an hour due to the lack of enforcement. Most of the flight line was also obscured by premium seating, making it difficult to see aircraft at times. Despite these challenges, I still enjoyed the event due to the exceptional static displays.  

Below are fifteen aircraft which were present at March Air Reserve Base: 

## Boeing P-26 Peashooter
