In 2017, I attended my first airshow at the Planes of Fame Air Museum. I had a budding interest in World War II aviation but had yet to see any aircraft in person. I thoroughly enjoyed being in the presence of historic warbirds, aerobatic performers, and modern military airpower. Since then, I have visited over twenty-five airshows across California and beyond.
