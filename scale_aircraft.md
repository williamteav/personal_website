## Scale Aircraft

![F-15](IMG_1360.JPG) 

My interest in historic aircraft took flight during my childhood when I came across a TV show named Dogfights on the History Channel. The narrator's apt description of the strengths and shortcomings of a particular model spurred me to learn more. I soon stumbled upon the world of scale modeling. It was definitely a step above my LEGO sets and the idea of purchasing an "unfinished" product seemed daunting at first. While I was tempted to just purchase a prepainted, assembled die-cast model, a part of me wanted to give the hobby a try. One model kit from the local hobby store later and the rest is history.
